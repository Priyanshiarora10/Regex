In docker all the files, folder, system are known as image
docker engine
container
hyperviser
image contains all os, dependencies, files/local host, software application
docker doesnot have os wheras it has images, containers, etc.

command 
1. docker images __(name of image)_= to see the image in the local host 
docker hub --> search the image --> 
2. docker search __(image name)__ = search the image on docker
3. docker pull __(image name)__ = to download the image for use 
4. docker run -it __(image name)__/bin/bash = create a container and start the container
bin =  default folder   
bash = .sh (type of terminal in linux)
-i = interactive mode 
-t = terminal(CLI)
5. docker run -it --name__(container name)____(image name)__/bin/bash  = drop image into into the specific container 

yum/apt
yum = linux
apt = 
windows --> IIS(web server)

Red Hat linux, Amazon linux = yum is use for only these linux 
apt 
6. sudo apt install docker -y = install the docker 
7. Sevice docker status = check the status of docker -- running / stopped
8. Docker start __(container name)__
# let we make 5 container in which 
2 start 
3 stop 
9. docker PS -a = check the container
PS = progresive service 
10. Docker PS = show only running container 
11. D0cker image = to see all the image in the local host
12. Docker stop = stop the container 
13. Docker attact __(container name)__ = if we exit the container and again use this container the use this command
14. Docker rm __(container name)__ = delete the container
15. Docker -v = see the version 
16. which docker

	practical
create an instance in ec2 linux
connect the instance 
sudo yum update 
y
sudo yum install docker
# sudo su name = switch root user
sevice docker status
service docker start 
docker -v (version)
which docker 
sudo -i
docker pull ubuntu 
docker ps
docker ps -a
docker image ls
which docker 
which ubuntu
ubuntu -v
docker -v
docker image
docker run -it --name democon ubuntu /bin/bash
docker search centos 
docker search chef
docker run -i -t --name cencon centos /bin/bash
docker run -i -t --name cencon2 centos /bin/bash
docker image ls 
docker ps -a 
docker start democon
exit
docker attach  democon
ubuntu -v
docker -v
cat /etc/os -release (check version in the os)

MAINTAINER my name is piyu
WORKDIR /tmp
ENV 
 /tmp = path 
vi Docker
